 Thessaloniki01 Customization
************************************************************************

 Thessaloniki01 provides simplified Google Maps 
 support for requests and offers.
 
 That is:  Start and Endpoint for both requests and offers 
 are provided by Google maps. The list of results returned by 
 google is filtered internally for those results that are 
 contained inside of the system's bound.
 Of those Results that pass the test, only the first is used
 to fill in the respective input.
 
 Thus, this interface provides simplified UI at the cost of
 less flexibility in picking a place.
