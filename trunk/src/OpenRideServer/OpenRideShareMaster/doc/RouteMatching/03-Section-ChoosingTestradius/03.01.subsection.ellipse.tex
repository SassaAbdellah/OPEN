\section{Deflection from the direct Line}
\index{Deflection!Definition of}
\index{Deflection!Maximum Defection}
Given two DRPs $d_1$ and $d_2$  and a path between these points,
by "Deflection" we denote the maximum distance between the Path and the direct line between $d_1$ and $d_2$.
Figure \ref{pic:deflectionDefinition} illustrates the deflection of a path.
We will now discuss the "Maximum Deflection" from the direct line between to DRPs.

\subsection{Maximum Deflection appears at Paths with \emph{exactly one} route point}
\label{Pathconstruction}

Keep in mind that a "Path" is composed of a finite number of RPs which are in turn connected by direct lines.
Given DRPs $d_1$ and $d_2$ and all paths of given length $d$ (and with arbitrary number of route points), 
we will now show that maximum deflection will appear at those paths which
have \emph{exactly one} route point.

More precisely, for every Path $P$ leading from $d_1$ to $d_2$ with RPs $rp_1,rp_2,.....,rp_n$ with deflection $h$ and length $d$, 
we can construct a path with $n-1$ routepoints and deflection $\tilde{h}$ \textgreater $h$ as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
	\item{From each triple of route points $rp_{j-1},rp_{j},rp_{j+1}$  where the three points are situated on
	      one direct line, eliminate the middle point $rp_{j}$. Note that this will not change the geometry of the path.
	      Iterate this process until there are no more three adjacent points on one line are left on the path.
	      }

	\item{From RPs $rp_1,rp_2,.....,rp_n$, chose an $rp_j$ such that the maximum deflection $h$ is realized at 
	      $rp_j$, and that there is one adjacent route point (wlog: $rp_{(j+1)}$}) such that
 	      the distance from $rp_{(j+1)}$ to the direct line between $d_1$ and $d_2$ is smaller than $h$.
	
	\item{Delete $rp_{j+1}$. Since there are no three points located on a line, the resuling path 
               $rp_1,rp_2,...,rp_j,rp_{j+2},..,rp_n$ is now shorter than the original path $rp_1,rp_2,.....,rp_n$
	      }

        \item{ It is now possible to replace $rp_j$ with a $\tilde{rp_j}$ further away from the direct line such that
	       the resulting Path  $\tilde{P}$ : $rp_1,rp_2,...,\tilde{rp_j},rp_{j+2},..,rp_n$ has length $d$,
	       and deflection greater than that of the original Path $P$, as desired. 	
	      }
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Ellipse}
\index{Ellipse}

As a consequence of section \ref{Pathconstruction} we can now assume that a maximum deflection 
(maximal with respect to all paths of given length $d$) is realized by a Path with only one single RP. 
Given $d_1$ and $d_2$, and a fixed $d$ all the possible route points $rp$ have the common property
that the sum of the distances from $rp$ to $d_1$ and $d_2$ is $d$.
As this is exactly the defining property of the ellipse, all  $rp$ are located on an ellipse
with focal points $d_1$ and $d_2$.


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/03.04.ellipse.eps}
\caption{ For all paths with just one single route point $rp$ and with given length $d$,
	  all possible locations or $rp$ are located on an eclipse with focalpoints
	  $d_1$ and $d_2$	
	}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Maximum Deflection as Function of the direct Distance between Drive\_Route\_Points}
\index{Direct Distance}
\index{Maximum Deflection!As function of the Direct Distance}
In view of the fact that an eclipse is symmetric, it becomes clear that for fixed $d$, the maximum
deflection becomes apparend exactly in the middle between $d_1$ and $d_2$.
With $\tilde{d}$ defined as the direct distance between $d_1$ and $d_2$, applying the Pythagorean Theorem,
the maximum deflection $h_{max}$ can be easily calculated to be:

\begin{equation}
 \label{HMaxOfD}  
 h_{max}(\tilde{d},d)=\sqrt{ \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\tilde{d}}{2}\right)^2 }
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{HMaxOfD} gives also an upper bound $h_{max}$ for $h_{max}(\tilde{d})$,
which is independent of $\tilde{d}$, and may be easier to calculate in some situations:

\begin{equation}
 \label{HMaxIndependent}  
 h_{max}=\frac{d}{2}
\end{equation}

Note also, that the independent bound in equation \ref{HMaxIndependent} is not completely unrealistic.
For example if points $d_1$ and $d_2$ are divided by some obstacle such as a railway or a river, then 
$\tilde{d}$ may come close to zero, and the bound in given in \ref{HMaxIndependent} gets realized.
