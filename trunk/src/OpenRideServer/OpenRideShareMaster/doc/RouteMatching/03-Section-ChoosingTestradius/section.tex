\chapter{Choosing the Test Radius around a DRP}
\label{choosingATestradius}
In this section we discuss the choice of the so called "testradius" 
which is assigned to every Drive\_Route\_Point.
During this section, we assume that there is a fixed distance named $d$
between the Drive\_Route\_Points in question.
The distance $d$ is not measured directly ("as the crow flies") but 
along the path between the DRPs.

We do not discuss the choice of $d$ here, as this will be discussed in chapter~\ref{choosingDistance}.
