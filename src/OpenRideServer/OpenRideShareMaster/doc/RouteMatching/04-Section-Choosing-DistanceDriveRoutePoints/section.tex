\chapter{Choosing the Distance between DRPs}
\label{choosingDistance}
In this section we present some considerations on how to choose the 
distance $d$ along the path between two DRs.

\subsection{The Defect} 

\begin{figure}

\caption{Demonstating the \emph{"Defect"}: All points within the \emph{red bar} have 		
         a distance not greater than h from the direct line, while all the points
	inside the gray bars have distance greater than $h$, but less than $h+dist$.
	All points locate inside either grey or red bars can be considered a success,
	while points located inside the circle of radius $t_r$ but outside the 
	bars can be considered  "false positives".
	}
\label{generalDefectFigure}
\end{figure}

A general measure and formula for the defect can be derived from figure \ref{generalDefectFigure}:
All positives are located inside the circle of testradius $t_r$ around $d_1$.
Of these, the \emph{"true positives"} are contained in the rectangle $F$ with height $2*h+2*dist$
and width $\tilde{d}$, where $\tilde{d}$ is the maximum of the direct distance between 
$d_1$ and either its left or right neighbor DR. 
To get a measure for the expected defect, we have to calculate the difference between 
the measure of the circle containing \emph{all positives} and the rectangle containing the \emph{true positives}:

\begin{equation}
\label{generalDefectFormulaFormally}
	D:=\pi*{t_r}^2-F
\end{equation}

From figure \ref{generalDefectFigure} the identity $F=(\tilde{d}*2(h+dist))$ can be read.
When this is substituted into the definition \ref{generalDefectFormulaFormally},
the definition takes on the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{generalDefectFormula}
        D:=\pi*{t_r}^2-(\tilde{d}*2(h+dist))
\end{equation}

In the rest of this section, we discuss how  the ratio between true positives and false positives 
can be minimized by a sensible choice of the parameter $d$. 

Assuming that interesting points are uniformly distributed in the plane, the
ratio between D and F is a measure for the ratio between all positives and false positives.
This gives:

\begin{equation}
\label{defectRatioFormula}
        \frac{D}{F}=\frac{\pi*{t_r}^2-(\tilde{d}*2(h+dist))}{(\tilde{d}*2(h+dist))}
\end{equation}


Hoever simple formula \ref{generalDefectFormula} may seem, keep in mind that the formal 
parameters $t_r$ and $\tilde{d}$ may themselves depend on the choice of $d$, while the 
deflection $h$ may vary between 0 and $d$ and depends on geography -- which  is largely out 
of \emph{our} control too.

For this reason, in what follows we discuss the optimal choice of $d$ for some 
special cases only.
