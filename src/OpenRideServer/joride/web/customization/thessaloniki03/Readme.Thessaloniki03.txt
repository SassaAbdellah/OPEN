 Thessaloniki03 Customization
************************************************************************

 Thessaloniki03 provides simplified Google Maps 
 support for requests and offers.
 
 In addition, Thessaloniki03 provides suppport for 
 specifying a timespan for which days/hours/minutes
 can be specified seperately.
 Normalizing the timespan is simplifyed w.r.t 
 Thessaloniki02 extension -- i.e: fields for minutes/hours/days
 are validated but there is no normalization.
 
 This extension does not make much sense, but provides an 
 instructive example for building extensions with single
 minute/hour/days fields for specifying the timespan.
